#TrueSTUDIO STM32 project to Makefile

This program generates a Makefile from TrueSTUDIO STM32 project. It works with both STM32CubeMX output as well as examples in ST's libraries. 
You will need GNU Make utility (www.gnu.org/software/make) and GNU tools for ARM (https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded) to compile output. Refer to my blog post http://www.ba0sh1.com/opensource-stm32-development for setting up of integrated development environment.
